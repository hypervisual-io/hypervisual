# CoDi Unstructured

## Requirement

This skill assumes the `codi-cli` skill is installed. Use `codi-cli` for shared `.codi` grammar, `codi help`, `codi validate`, `codi render`, scan, diff, and diagnostic workflow.

## Use This Diagram Type For

- You need readable topology but not a strict semantic model.
- Node types are domain-specific or experimental.
- You want rich visual styling and nested groups without strict validation.

## Avoid This Diagram Type When

- You need C4, UML, STRIDE, or Gantt-specific validation.
- A strict diagram type exists for the domain and should catch mistakes.

## Authoring Workflow

1. Read `references/authoring.md` for diagram selection and common patterns.
2. Read `references/vocabulary.md` and `references/properties.md` before writing detailed nodes or edges.
3. Use examples from `references/examples/` as source templates.
4. Validate with `codi validate <file>`.
5. Render with `codi render <file> --format svg -o <file.svg>` when the CLI is available.
