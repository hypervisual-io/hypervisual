# CoDi Sequence

## Requirement

This skill assumes the `codi-cli` skill is installed. Use `codi-cli` for shared `.codi` grammar, `codi help`, `codi validate`, `codi render`, scan, diff, and diagnostic workflow.

## Use This Diagram Type For

- Explaining request/response flows, login flows, async work, callbacks, retries, or lifecycle behavior.
- Source order matters and messages should appear vertically in time order.
- You need sequence-specific constructs such as activation, replies, notes, and fragments.

## Avoid This Diagram Type When

- The goal is static system topology; use C4 or unstructured instead.
- The goal is a generic process with decisions and parallel branches; use activity or flowchart.

## Authoring Workflow

1. Read `references/authoring.md` for diagram selection and common patterns.
2. Read `references/vocabulary.md` and `references/properties.md` before writing detailed nodes or edges.
3. Use examples from `references/examples/` as source templates.
4. Validate with `codi validate <file>`.
5. Render with `codi render <file> --format svg -o <file.svg>` when the CLI is available.
